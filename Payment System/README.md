This is a payment system program made as a project for the second semester of my faculty. This project has been made with the help
of another student and the purpose was the better understanding of threads and threads synchronization. The project has a built in server
that helps creating a concurrent environment. The project has been linked to the DB by using JPA .
The graphic interface is made using javaFx .

Note that the above Folder dosn't contain all the folders,so an import won't be possible . It contains all the files needed 
(classes and the sql sript,fxml, imgs, etc.).

What the app does(short): The clients can register(data saved in mysql db), login and pay their bills using this system.
They can also subscribe to providers, unsubscribe, add funds to their account and activate an automatic payment system.
The server connects to the database, handles concurrent clients and runs the automatic payment system. It also sends notifications 
to the clients, when a bill was automaticly paid.
